# Delegate subdomains' SSL certificates to Adobe {#delegate-ssl-certificates}

>abstract="Control Panel allows you to have your subdomains' SSL certificates managed by Adobe. If you are using CNAMEs to set up your subdomain, certificates records will be automatically generated and provided in order to generate a certificate into your domain hosting solution."

Delegating management of your subdomains' SSL certificates to Adobe is strongly recommended, as Adobe will automatically create the certificate and renew it every year before the certificate expires.

If you are using CNAMEs to set up a subdomain delegation, Adobe will provide certificate records to use into your domain hosting solution to generate your certificate.

SSL certificates' delegation to Adobe can be performed when setting up a new subdomain or for already delegated subdomains.

>[!NOTE]

>Adobe managed SSL is a cost-free feature that is available to users at no charge. Delegating the certificate of a subdomain to Adobe is transparent and has no impact on your campaigns and the deliverability. [Learn more on SSL certificates management](monitoring-ssl-certificates.md#management)


## Delegate new subdomains' SSL certificates {#new}

To delegate SSL certificates when setting up a new subdomain, enable the **[!UICONTROL Opt for Adobe managed SSL for sub-domains]** option of the subdomain configuration wizard. The certificate generation process differs based on your subdomain delegation method:

* **Full subdomain delegation**: The SSL certificate is automatically requested and installed by Adobe without any action required from you. Once you submit the subdomain configuration, the certificate installation request is processed immediately as part of the subdomain setup workflow. [Learn more on full subdomain delegation](setting-up-new-subdomain.md#full-subdomain-delegation)

* **CNAME delegation**: Certificate records to copy into your hosting solution will be provided later on in the configuration wizard. You need to generate these certificate records in your domain hosting solution before submitting the subdomain configuration. [Learn more on CNAME delegation](setting-up-new-subdomain.md#use-cnames)

## Delegate SSL certificates for already delegated subdomains {#delegated}

To delegate SSL certificates for an already delegated subdomain, click the ellipsis button next to the desired subdomain and click **[!UICONTROL Switch to Managed SSL]**.

The certificate generation process depends on how the subdomain was originally configured:

### Fully delegated subdomains

For subdomains that were set up using full subdomain delegation (with Adobe nameservers), the SSL certificate is automatically requested and installed by Adobe. Once you click **[!UICONTROL Switch to Managed SSL]** and confirm, the certificate installation request is submitted immediately without requiring any additional action from you.

### CNAME delegated subdomains
    
For subdomains that were set up using CNAME delegation, a dialog box displays with the certificate records that have been automatically generated by Adobe. Copy these records, either one by one, or by downloading a CSV file, then navigate to your domain hosting solution to generate the matching certificate. 

Make sure that all the certificate records have been generated into your domain hosting solution. If everything is configured properly, confirm the records creation then click **[!UICONTROL Submit]**.
