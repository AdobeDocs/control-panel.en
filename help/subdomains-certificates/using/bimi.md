## About BIMI records {#about}

Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) is an industry standard that allows an approved logo to appear next to a senderâ€™s email in mailbox providers' inboxes to enhance brand recognition and trust. It helps prevent email spoofing and phishing by verifying the sender's identity through DMARC authentication, making it more difficult for malicious actors to impersonate legitimate brands in emails. Detailed information on BIMI implementation is available in [Adobe Deliverability Best Practice Guide](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/deliverability-learn/deliverability-best-practice-guide/additional-resources/technotes/implement-bimi.html)

## Limitations & prerequisites {#limitations}

* SPF, DKIM and DMARC records are prerequisites for creating a BIMI record.
* BIMI records can only be added for subdomains using Full subdomain delegation. [Learn more on subdomains configuration methods](subdomains-branding.md#subdomain-delegation-methods)
* Each subdomain can have only 1 BIMI record.
* DMARC record policy type for the subdomain must be set to "Quarantine" or "Reject". BIMI record creation is not available with a DMARC policy type set to "None". [Learn how to add DMARC records](dmarc.md)
