Identifying events planned on your instances is essential to monitor your Campaign instances.

With Control Panel, you can monitor releases and service reviews occurring on your instances and access a list of key contacts at Adobe for any request or issue.

These information are accessible from the **[!UICONTROL Service Calendar]** card on Control Panel homepage.

## Key contacts {#key-contacts}

The **[!UICONTROL Key contacts]** section lists the persons at Adobe that you can contact for any request or issue on your instances.
