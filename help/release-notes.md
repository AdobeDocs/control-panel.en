## January 2020 {#january-2020}

Weâ€™ve added new capabilities for Admin users to configure subdomains and renew SSL certificates from Control Panel.

For more information, refer to these pages:
* [Setting up a new subdomain](subdomains-certificates/using/setting-up-new-subdomain.md)
* [Renewing a subdomain's SSL certificate](subdomains-certificates/using/renewing-subdomain-certificate.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]

>These features will be available in beta, and subject to frequent updates and modifications without notice.

## September 2019 {#september-2019}

Weâ€™ve added new capabilities for Admin users to add IP addresses to the allow list in order to connect to Campaign v7/v8 instances.
Additionally, Admin users can now view the list of Campaign v7/v8 instances and eligibility for build upgrades.

For more information, refer to the [dedicated documentation](instances-settings/using/ip-allow-listing-instance-access.md).

## August 2019 {#august-2019}

Weâ€™ve added new capabilities for Admin users to receive notifications before SSL certificates for their domains expire. For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](subdomains-certificates/using/monitoring-ssl-certificates.md).

Additionally, Admin users can now delete SSH keys that were added to access SFTP servers.

## July 2019 {#july-2019}

We've added new features to empower Admin users to take greater control of Campaign v7/v8 instance settings. New Control Panel capabilities include the ability to add URLs that Adobe Campaign connect to for data/file transfers.

For more information, refer to the [detailed documentation](instances-settings/using/url-permissions.md).
