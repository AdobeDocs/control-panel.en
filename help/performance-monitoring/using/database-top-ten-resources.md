# Top 10 temporary resources {#top-10}

The **[!UICONTROL Top 10 temporary resources]** area lists the 10 largest temporary resources generated by workflows and deliveries.

Monitoring workflows and deliveries that are creating large temporary resources is a key step to monitor your database. If any temporary resource is consuming too much database space, make sure that having this workflow or delivery is necessary, and eventually navigate to your instance to stop it.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>General recommendation is to avoid having **more than 40 columns** in non out of the box resources. If a workflow is found to have a large number of table counts or database size, we recommend reviewing the workflow in order to investigate why it is generating so much data.
>
>Campaign Standard and Classic guidelines are also available in [this page](database-preventing-overload.md) to help you prevent database overload.
