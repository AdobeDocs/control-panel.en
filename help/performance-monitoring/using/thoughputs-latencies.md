# Throughtputs and latencies monitoring {#throughputs-latencies-monitoring}

Monitoring how delivery throughputs and latencies are trending over a period of time is essential to understand the usage of your instances and ensure they are performing well.

These information are available in Control Panel for each of your Campaign instances in the **[!UICONTROL Performance Monitoring]** card, **[!UICONTROL Throughputs & Latencies]** tab.

>[!NOTE]

>By default, data is displayed for the current day. You can change the displayed period of time using the **[!UICONTROL 6 months]**, **[!UICONTROL 30 days]** and **[!UICONTROL 7 days]** buttons.

The **[!UICONTROL Throughput]** area provides information regarding the number of deliveries sent per hour from the selected Campaign instance for all the communication channels.

You can display these information in a table with sortable columns rather than a graph. To do this, click the **[!UICONTROL Visualization settings]** button then select **[!UICONTROL Table]**.

The **[!UICONTROL Latency]** area provides information regarding the latencies encountered on the selected instance when sending transactional communications. Information is available for both 95p and 99p latencies, meaning that 95% and 99% of the requests should be faster than the given latency.
