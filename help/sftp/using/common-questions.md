# Common questions {#common-questions}

**My organization has two SFTP servers. How come I only see the one that is attached to my Production instance?**

You most likely need to get an access to the Stage/Dev instance in order to be able to manipulate stage/dev instances’ SFTP server.

Reach out to your Organization Administrators so that they add you to the instance's admin users list for the desired stage/dev instance. Detailed information is available [here](../../discover/using/managing-permissions.md).

**My organization would like to use FTP servers rather than SFTP servers, can we do that?**

FTP servers won’t be hosted by Adobe.
