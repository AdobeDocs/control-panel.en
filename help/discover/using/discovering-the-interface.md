# Discovering Control Panel interface {#discovering-interface}

The Control Panel home page gives you access to all actions that can be performed on your Campaign instances.

They are represented by cards that are organized into topics, for example **Storage & Database Management**.

With upcoming Campaign releases, more topics and cards will be made available.
