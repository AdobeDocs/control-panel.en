Campaign Control Panel helps you increase efficiency in your work as a product admin of Campaign Standard and V7/v8, by allowing you to manage settings and track usages for each of your Campaign instances.

## What's new

**DMARC & BIMI records management**

You can now add DMARC & BIMI records directly from Control Panel:

* **DMARC records** provide a way to authenticate the sender's domain and prevent unauthorized use of the domain for malicious purposes. [Learn how to add DMARC records](subdomains-certificates/using/dmarc.md)


* **BIMI records** allow you to display an approved logo next to your emails in mailbox providers' inboxes to enhance brand recognition and trust. [Learn how to add BIMI records](subdomains-certificates/using/bimi.md)

>[!CAUTION]
>
>* Control Panel is restricted to Admin users. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/control-panel/using/discover-control-panel/managing-permissions.html#discover-control-panel)
>
>* For Campaign v7, deployment restrictions apply. [Learn more](faq.md#v7-restrictions)
