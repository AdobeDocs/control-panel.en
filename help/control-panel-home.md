Campaign Control Panel helps you increase efficiency in your work as a product admin of Campaign Standard and V7/v8, by allowing you to manage settings and track usages for each of your Campaign instances.

## What's new

**User interface**

* Control Panel is now available in additional languages. [Learn more](discover/using/discovering-the-interface.md#supported-languages-languages)

**Active profiles monitoring**

* You can now monitor the number of active profiles you are entitled to for your organization, and the total count of profiles used in your organization within all instances, if you are using multiple instances. [Learn more](performance-monitoring/using/active-profiles-monitoring.md)

**DMARC records**

* Multiple email addresses can now receive aggregate report and failure report emails. [Learn more](subdomains-certificates/using/dmarc.md)
* Changes have been made if both DMARC and BIMI records exist for a subdomain:

    * DMARC records cannot deleted. If you want to delete one, you need to delete the BIMI record first.
    * DMARC records can be edited, but the policy downgrade to "None" is not allowed and its percentage value must be 100.

>[!CAUTION]
>
>* Control Panel is restricted to Admin users. [Learn more](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/control-panel/using/discover-control-panel/managing-permissions.html#discover-control-panel)
>
>* For Campaign v7, deployment restrictions apply. [Learn more](faq.md#v7-restrictions)
