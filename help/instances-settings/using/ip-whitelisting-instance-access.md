# IP whitelisting {#about-ip-whitelisting}

The Control panel lets you manage your Campaign Classic instances settings, like for example the URLs to which the instances can connect, or the IP addresses that are allowed to connect to your instance.

For more information on the Control Panel itself, refer to [this section]().

## IP whitelisting for instance access {ip-whitelistig-instance-access}

By default, your Adobe Campaign Classic instance is not accessible from various IP addresses.

If your IP address has not been whitelisted, you will not be able to login to the instance from this address. The same way, you may not be able to connect an API to your Message Center or Marketing instance if the IP address has not been whitelisted with the instance explicitly.

Control Panel allows you to set up new connections to your instances by whitelisting IP addresses ranges. To do this, follow the steps described below.

Once IP addresses whitelisted, you can create and link Campaign operators to them so that the users can access the instance.
