## About instance details {#about-instance-details}

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>This feature is available for Campaign Classic instances only.

Your Adobe Campaign Classic instance architecture can contain several servers to enable the flexibility of marketing activities. For example, you can have Marketing, Real Time (or Message Center) and Mid Sourcing servers supporting your instance. 

The Instance Details functionality allows you to view flat architecture of your instance. In addition to server information, it also lets you know whether or not your instance build is current, as well as recommends upgrades when needed. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>We recommend that your instances are upgraded at least once a year in order to avoid performance degradation, and be able to take the advantage of the newest features and fixes Adobe Campaign Classic has to offer.

## Common questions {#common-questions}

**I do not see the MID server on my instance architecture, does it mean my instances are not functioning correctly? Do I need the RT instance for something I am not able to do today?**

Your own instance can look very different, and it may not have all types of servers, or it can have several of the same server. Not having one type of the server or another does not mean you cannot send a real-time message or perform other kinds of activities. You can request additional server capacity, additional fees will apply.

Please contact Customer Care if you believe some servers are not showing in the "Instance Details" page. Make sure you note the specific instance URL in your message.
